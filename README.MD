# Management system
ðŸ“š Hi!This is a PHP application written with Symfony framework. ðŸ“š 

# Description 
In the project, there are three entities: User, Admin, and Group.
In order to start an application, you should log in as admin (ex. email: k@gmail.com , password: 123456789) or register.
Only the admin can reach and modify data in the application. It is possible to create new users and groups as well as delete them. Additionally, users can be assigned to groups (Note: If a user is already in the group, you can't assign the user one more time. Otherwise, you will get an error). Users can be as well deleted from the group. The application will show you success messages if action went well and error messages another way around.
